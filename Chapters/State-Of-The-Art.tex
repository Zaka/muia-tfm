\section{Automated Bitcoin Trading via Machine Learning Algorithms}

In this paper by \cite{madan_automated_2014} they try to forecast the
price of BTC for periods of 24h (phase one), 10 minutes and 10 seconds
(phase two), obtaining an accuracy of $98.7\%$ for phase one and
$50\% - 55\%$ for phase two. The data for phase one consists of about
25 features relating to the BTC price and payment network over the
course of five years, recorded daily. They did a manual feature
selection based on the research of the significance to the problem of
forecasting. The final result is a 16 feature set collected daily. For
