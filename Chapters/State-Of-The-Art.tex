\section[\cite{madan_automated_2014}] {Automated Bitcoin Trading
  via Machine Learning Algorithms}

\label{sec:automated-bitcoin-trading-via-machine-learning-algorithms}

\cite{madan_automated_2014} forecast the price of BTC for periods
of 24h (phase one) and 10 minutes/seconds (phase two), obtaining an
accuracy of $98.7\%$
for phase one and $50\% - 55\%$
for phase two. The data set for \textit{first phase} consists of about
16 features (shown in \autoref{tab:bitcoin-features-madan}) relating
to the BTC price and payment network over the course of five years,
recorded daily. The features were selected manually based on research
of the significance to the problem of forecasting. For the
\textit{second phase} the data consisted of 10-second and 10-minute
interval BTC price.

In \textit{first phase} they used Binomial GLM, SVM and Random Forest.
Binomial GLM shows higher precision \& accuracy that the other two
algorithms.

For the \textit{second phase} they used only Binomial GLM and Random
Forest. Performing 10 second and 10 minute prediction with Binomial
GLM and comparing with 10 minute prediction for Random Forest. It
turns out that Random Forest shows the higher accuracy \& precision
than GLM in both 10 seconds and 10 minutes interval prediction.

\section[\cite{georgoula_using_2015}]{Using Time-Series and Sentiment
  Analysis to detect the Determinants of Bitcoin Prices}

\label{sec:using-time-series-and-sentiment-analysis}

\cite{georgoula_using_2015} used time-series analysis to study the
relationship between Bitcoin prices and fundamental economic
variables, technological factors and measurements of collective mood
derived from Twitter feeds. They conclude that Bitcoin price is
positively associated with the number of Bitcoins in circulation and
negatively associated with the Standard and Poor's 500 stock market
index.

\begin{table}

  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Bitcoin features selected by

  \label{tab:bitcoin-features-georgoula-2015}
\end{table}

They used time-series to forecast the Bitcoin price and SVM to
classify the Tweet feeds sentiment.

As seen by ordinary least square regression model obtained, the paper
suggests the next conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{logwiki} (representing the degree of public recognition
  or interest in Bitcoins) and \textit{loghash} (measuring the mining
  difficulty) have a positive impact on Bitcoin price 
\item The exchange rate between the USD and the euro relationship is
  negative 
\item The sentiment ration of Twitter users, and the number of
  Wikipedia search queries positively affects the price of Bitcoins
\item The stock of Bitcoins has a positive long-run impact on its
  price 
\item The Standard and Poor's 500 index was found to have a negative
  impact on Bitcoin prices in the long run
\end{itemize}

\section[\cite{kristoufek_what_2015}]{What are the main drivers of the
  Bitcoin price? Evidence from Wavelet Coherence Analysis}
\label{sec:where-are-the-main-drivers-of-the-bitcoin-price}

\cite{kristoufek_what_2015} examines in this paper the potential
drivers of Bitcoin price by means of wavelet coherence analysis of
different variables. This paper doesn't try to perform a forecast,
just select the variables that are \textit{``drive''} the price of
BTC.

The conclusions after the analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{Trade Exchange Ratio} has a strong , but not
  statistically significant at the 5\% level, relationship at high
  scales. The price and the ratio are negatively correlated in the
  long term
\item Bitcoin appreciates in the long run if it is used more for
  trade, i.e., non-exchange transactions, and hte increasing price
  boosts the exchange transactions in the short run
\item The money supply works as a standard supply, so that its
  increase leads to a price decrease
\item For the trade transactions, the increasing usage of bitcois in
  real transactions leads to an appreciation of the bitcoin in the
  long run
\item For the trade volume the relationship changes in time to offer
  any strong conclusion.
\item Both measures of the mining difficulty (\textit{Hash} and
  \textit{Difficulty}) are positively correlated with the price in the
  long run
\item In the short run, Bitcoin price and both \textit{Hash} and
  \textit{Difficulty} relationship becomes negative
\item The interest (\textit{Google} and \textit{Wikipedia}) in Bitcoin
  appears to have an asymmetric effect during the bubble formation and
  its bursting. During the bubble formation, interest boosts the
  prices further, and during the bursting, it pushes them lower.
\item For the \textit{FSI}, apart from the Cypriot crisis, there are
  no longer-term time intervals during which the correlations are both
  statistically significant and realiable
\item Gold price apparently has no relationship with BTC price
\item Although the USD and CNY (Chinese renminbi) markets are tightly
  connected, there is no clear evidence that the Chinese market
  influences the USD market.

\section[\cite{garcia_social_2015}]{Social signals and algorithmic
  trading of Bitcoin}
\label{sec:social-signals-and-algorithmic-trading-of-bitcoin}

This paper by \cite{garcia_social_2015} provides a consistent approach
that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic
traders. They applied multidimensional model of vector auto-regression
to design different types of trading algorithms. The analysis
performed reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange
volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence
precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. They
choosed a number of Bitcoin related variables based on the work of
other researchers. They can be seen in
\autoref{tab:bitcoin-features-garcia}.

forecasting and classification techniques are compared to three
important AI techniques, namely, artificial neural networks, expert
systems and hybrid intelligence systems. For the purpose of this
thesis we are going to show the results related to ANNs in

  \caption{Comparisons between ANN model/s in financial prediction and

  \label{tab:ann-compared-to-others}
\end{table}

I want to include the next quote from the article because describes
very well how NNs behave in a financial scenario: \textit{``Regarding
  NNs, the empirical results of these comparative studies indicate
  that the success of NNs in financial domain, especially in financial
  prediction and planning, is very encouraging. (However, while NNs
  often outperform the more traditional and statistical approaches but
  this is not always the case. There are some studies in which other
  traditional methods, or intelligent approach outperforms NNs.) This
  success is due to some unique characteristics of NNs in financial
  market like their numeric nature, no requirement to any data
  distribution assumptions (for inputs) and model estimators and
  finally, their capability to update the data. Despite this success,
  this paper could not conclude that NNs are very accurate techniques
  in financial market because at the first, among these studies, BPNN
  is the most popular NN training technique. However, BPNN suffers
  from the potential problems. One of the problems of BPNN is local
  minimum convergence. Because the gradient search process proceeds in
  a point-to-point mode and is intrinsically local in scope,
  convergence to local rather than global minima is a very
  possibility. Also BP training method is very slow and takes too much
  time to converge. Besides, it can over fit the training data.
  Secondly, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the
  proper size and structure of a neural net to solve a given problem.
  Therefore, the architectural parameters are generally designed by
  researchers and via trial and errors and since these parameters
  determine outputs of NNs, their accuracy and performance are subject
  to numerous errors. Also sometimes NNs are incapable to recognize
  patterns and establish relevant relationships between various
  factors, which are important reasons to reduce their performance.
  Finally, NNs learn based on past occurrences, which may not be
  repeated, especially in financial markets and in current financial
  crisis.''}

\section[\cite{atsalakis2009surveying}]{Surveying stock market
  forecasting techniques - Part II: Soft computing methods}
\label{sec:surveing-stock-market-forecasting-techniques:part2}

This paper enumerates over a 100 scientific articles applied to stock
market forecasting with a focus on neural networks and neuro-fuzzy
techniques. \cite{atsalakis2009surveying} enumerate the modeling
techniques used to forecast, the stock markets whose information are
used (not very useful for this thesis because we are interested in
Bitcoin where the information source is clear), the input variables,
which we summarize in \autoref{tab:input-variables-atsalakis2009},
whether they perform data processing, sample sizes, network layers,
membership functions, validation set and training method. They also
show the methods used to compare with for each article without giving
the conclusions made in each article. Another very interesting
information are the \textit{model performance measures} where the
measures are classified as statistical and non-statistical measures:
\textit{``Statistical measures include the root mean square error
  (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean squared
  prediction error (MSPE), statistical indicators like the
  autocorrelation, the correlation coefficient, the mean absolute
  deviation, the squared correlation and the standard deviation. [...]
  Non-statistical performance measures include measures that are
  related with the economical side of the forecast. The most common
  used performance measure is the so called Hit Rate that measures the
  percentage of correct predictions of the model. Another two measures
  that deal with the profitability of the model are the annual rate of
  return and the average annual profit of the model''}

As a conclusion, they mention that: \textit{``The observation is that
  neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models are suitable for stock market
  forecasting. Experiments demonstrate that soft computing techniques
  outperform conventional models in most cases. They return better
  results as trading systems and higher forecasting accuracy. However,
  difficulties arise when defining the structure of the model (the
  hidden layers the neurons etc.). For the time being, the structure
  of the model is a matter of trial and error procedures.``}

\section[\cite{carpinteiro2012forecasting}]{Forecasting models for
  prediction in time series}
\label{sec:forecasting-models-for-prediction-in-time-series}

\cite{carpinteiro2012forecasting} give a comparison of three
forecasting models: a multilayer perceptron, a support vector machine,
and a hierarchical model. After performing six experiments running
through time series of the stock market fund on Bank of Brasil, they
concluded that the performance of HM is better than SVM and MLP. As a
possible explanation, they suggest that the superiority of HM can be
due to its hierarchical architecture.

The 75\% of papers reviewed use some sort of lagged index data as
input variables. Most commonly used parameters are daily opening,
high, low and close prices. Also several technical indicators are
used, been the more important: Simple moving average (SMA),
exponential moving average (EMA), relative strength index (RSI), rate
of change (ROC), moving average convergence / divergence (MACD) and
William's oscillator and average true range (ATR).
\autoref{tab:reviewed-papers-by-input-variables} displays the number

techniques , and no benchmark model. The relationship between
categories and the studies is reproduced in

An interesting quote made by \cite{krollner2010financial} is:
\textit{``Over 80\% of the papers report that their model outperformed
  the benchmark model. However, most analysed studies do not consider
  real world constraints like trading costs and splippage.``}

As one of the conclusions of the review they state that artificial
neural networks are the dominant techniques for the field of financial

This paper reviews ANNs, GAs and PSOs, and compare their application
in financial domain, dividing, as previous papers did, in three
subdomains: portfolio managemente, financial forecasting and planning,
and credit evaluation. ANNs prove to be a good method when compared to
traditional techniques, and to note that, they say: \textit{``In 2008,
  two Artificial NNs were developed by Angelini et al. . One of them
  was based on a regular feed-forward model and the other one had
  specific purpose architecture. The performance of the system was
  assessed using real world data, acquired from small corporations in
  Italia. They proved that if data analysis and preprocessing are done
  carefully, and suitable training is carried out, then Artificial NNs
  will demonstrate a powerful performance in estimating and learning
  the default direction of a borrower.''}, as shown in

As for GAs and PSOs there aren't as much evidence of their suitability
for financial domain apart from this quote: \textit{``Mahfoud and Mani
  address the general problem of predicting future performances of
  individual stocks. They compare a genetic-algorithm-based system to
  an established neural network system on roughly 5000
  stock-prediction experiments. According to their experiments, both
  systems significantly outperform the B\&H strategy''}

Their conclusion is that \textit{``the performance and accuracy of the
  above mentioned artificial intelligence techniques are considerably
  higher, compared to the traditional statistical techniques,
  particularly in nonlinear models. Nevertheless, this superiority is
  not true in all cases.''}

\section[\cite{verikas2010hybrid}]{Hybrid and ensemble-based soft
  computing techniques in bankruptcy prediction: a survey}
\label{sec:hybrid-and-ensemble-based}

\cite{verikas2010hybrid} presents a comprehensive review of hybrid and
ensemble-based soft computing techniques applied to bankruptcy. The
focus is on techniques and not on obtained results, given that almost
all authors demonstrate that the technique they propose outperforms
some other methods chosen for the comparison.

This paper presents some techniques, which are shown in
\autoref{tab:hybrid-and-ensemble-based}, and then they draw some
conclusions. They mention that \textit{``fair comparison of results
  obtained in the different studies is hardly possible''} due to the
different dataset used, and different sizes of these datasets.
\textit{``Nonetheless the difficulty in comparing the reviewed
  techniques, one can make a general observation that ensembles, when
  properly designed, are more accurate than the other techniques. This
  is expected, since an ensemble integrates several predictors. In a
  successful ensemble design, a tradeoff between the ensemble accuracy
  and the diversity of ensemble members is achieved. [...]. However,
  transparency of ensemble-based techniques is rather limited, when
  compared to RS or IF-THEN rules- based approaches.''}

    k-NN classifier (\cite{bian2003fuzzy}). \\

    FS + MLP + GA & FS used to extract rules from MLP, which are then
    optimized by GA (\cite{lu2006explanatory}). \\
    
    FS + MOCO & FS used to extract rules, which are then optimized by

    self-organization (\cite{lee2006brain, ang2003popfnn, tung2004genso}).\\

    SOM + MLP & Prediction results obtained from MLP are superimposed
    on SOM visualizing the financial data (\cite{sun2008listed}); SOM is
    trained using the financial data augmented with the prediction
    obtained from the MLP (\cite{huysmans2006failure}).\\

    NT + MLP & Feature set for MLP is augmented with Mahalanobis
    distance measures (\cite{markham1995combining}; features are

    network trained on a separate bagged data set
    (\cite{chan2006bankruptcy}).\\ 

    RBF & Diversity is promoted during the GA-based feature selection
    by including a diversity term in the fitness function. Features
    are selected simultaneously for all members
    (\cite{yeung2007bankruptcy, yeung2007multiple}).\\

    DT & An ensemble of DT created using the AdaBoost algorithm
    (Alfaro et al. 2008; Cortes et al. 2007).\\

\end{table}

When referening to feature set used for predicting bankruptcy, they
mention: \textit{``Different studies indicate that the bankruptcy
  prediction accuracy can be increased substantially by including
  non-financial features into the modeling process and a trend is on
  using non-financial features, for example macroeconomic indicators
  and qualitative variables, in addition to financial ratios. [...].
  Genetic algorithms and RS are the two most popular approaches to
  feature selection in hybrid and ensemble-based techniques for
  bankruptcy prediction.''}

As a major downside of soft computing thechniques their conclusion is:
\textit{``The non-linear nature of hybrid and ensemble-based models
  and the lack of a widely accepted procedures for designing such
  models are major factors contributing to pitfalls in applications of
  these technologies. Model building, model selection and comparison
  are the designing steps where the most common pitfalls occur due to
  small sample sizes, model over-fitting or under-fitting, the
  sensitivity of solutions to initial conditions. The problem of
  selecting a model of appropriate complexity is often forgotten when
  developing soft computing techniques for bankruptcy prediction.''}
